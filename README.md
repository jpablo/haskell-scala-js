# Scala for Pythonistas

Created: Fri Jul 07 13:33:41 PDT 2017

This is an introductory tutorial to Scala from a Python's developer point of view. 

It follows loosely the Python tutorial at [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

The goal is to start with familiar concepts and slowly venture into newer territory. In particular, discussion of types is avoided as much as possible. They will be discussed at length in a future installment.
