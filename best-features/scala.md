# Best features of Scala

## Concise syntax (compared to Java / C++)
## Powerful type system
## Flexible syntax (good for DSLs)
## Collection libraries
a lot of methods

too many of them

crazy class hierarchy

too many options imported by default

No clear distinction between mutable / immutable interfaces

Hard to read type signatures (CanBuildFrom)

## Scala meta

# Worst features

* no global type inference
* Implicits are powerful but are much harder to use than
Haskell's type classes

* Type level programming can get tricky
(heavy syntax)
