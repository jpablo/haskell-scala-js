# Installation

Most of the examples discussed here do not require a full Scala installation.  

If / when you need to create a complete Scala project with modules, test runner, etc. then refer to [Full Scala installation](9-setting-up-a-full-project.md).

## Using a standalone Scala REPL {#ammonite}

The examples in this tutorial assume you have installed the Ammonite REPL (which is similar to IPython).


1. Install Java: [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
1. Download and install Ammonite: <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL" target="_blank">http://www.lihaoyi.com/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL</a>. 

Again you can copy/paste most of the examples into the Ammonite REPL.

It's worth mentioning that you can get a lot of mileage with just Ammonite, specially for quick and dirty scripts.


## Trying out Scala on the Browser {#browser}

If you just want to try Scala in the browser without having to install anything
then you can use
<a href="https://scastie.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scastie</a>.

You can copy / paste most of the examples.


## Editor Support {#editor}

* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + the Scala syntax plugin provide good support for "light" editing.

* Many people use IntelliJ Idea for regular development; since it is a full blown IDE with color syntax, refactoring capabilities, code analysis, type error information, etc.
